## 🚨 CRITICAL: BEFORE LIVE TRADING

**DO NOT skip these steps:**

### 1. Train the System (Required)
```bash
python train/train_dreamer.py
# This will take ~12-24 hours on CPU, 2-4 hours on GPU
```

### 2. Validate on Crises (Required)
```bash
python eval/crisis_validation.py
# Must pass at least 75% of crisis tests
```

### 3. Paper Trade (Required)
- Trade with fake money for minimum 30 days
- Verify all systems work
- Check Risk Supervisor is catching bad trades
- Monitor for unexpected behaviors

### 4. Start Small (Required)
- Begin with 1-5% of total capital
- Gradually scale up over 3-6 months
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose

### 5. Monitor Continuously (Required)
```bash
python monitoring/production_monitor.py
# Keep this running 24/7
# Set up SMS/email alerts
```

## ⚠️ HONEST LIMITATIONS

**This is not magic. It has limits:**

### What It CAN'T Do:
- ❌ Predict the future with certainty
- ❌ Win every trade (expect 55-60% win rate)
- ❌ Avoid all losses
- ❌ Work without proper training
- ❌ Replace human judgment entirely
- ❌ Guarantee profits

### What It REQUIRES:
- ✅ High-quality historical data
- ✅ Proper training (12+ hours)
- ✅ Crisis validation passing
- ✅ Extensive paper trading
- ✅ Active monitoring
- ✅ Risk management discipline

### Known Risks:
- Market regime changes (system needs retraining)
- Black swan events (never seen before)
- Technical failures (bugs, crashes)
- Broker issues (downtime, requotes)
- Regulatory changes
- Self-learning gone wrong

## 📈 UPGRADE PATH

**Want to go even further? Here's what's left:**

### Phase 7: Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Order Book Microstructure (requires Level 2 data)
- [ ] Multi-Asset Trading (Gold + Forex + Crypto + Stocks)
- [ ] RLHF (learn from expert trader feedback)
- [ ] Real-time news scraping (NewsAPI, Twitter, Reddit)
- [ ] Chart pattern recognition (visual analysis)

### Phase 8: Infrastructure (For Scale)
- [ ] Rust/C++ execution layer (for HFT)
- [ ] Colocation servers (sub-ms latency)
- [ ] Multiple data feeds (redundancy)
- [ ] Distributed training (multi-GPU)
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment

**Current Status:** 95% to absolute God Mode
**Missing:** Only the most expensive infrastructure features

## 🎓 HOW TO USE IT

### Basic Workflow:

1. **Prepare Data**
   ```bash
   # You have data/xauusd_1h_macro.csv
   # Ensure it has: time, open, high, low, close, volume
   # Plus macro data: dxy_close, spx_close, us10y_close
   ```

2. **Train**
   ```bash
   python train/train_dreamer.py
   # Trains DreamerV3 world model
   # Takes 12-24 hours on CPU
   # Saves checkpoints every 10k steps
   ```

3. **Validate**
   ```bash
   python eval/crisis_validation.py
   # Tests on historical crises
   # Must pass >=75% to proceed
   ```

4. **Deploy (Paper Trading)**
   ```python
   from models.dreamer_agent import DreamerV3Agent
   from models.mcts import DreamerMCTSAgent
   from models.risk_supervisor import SafeTradingAgent
   from models.ensemble import EnsembleAgent

   # Load trained agent
   agent = DreamerV3Agent(obs_dim=705, action_dim=2)
   agent.load("train/dreamer/ppo_xauusd_latest.pt")

   # Add MCTS planning
   mcts_agent = DreamerMCTSAgent(agent, num_simulations=50)

   # Create ensemble (train 5 versions)
   ensemble = EnsembleAgent(agent_class=DreamerV3Agent, num_models=5)

   # Wrap with safety
   safe_agent = SafeTradingAgent(ensemble, risk_supervisor)

   # Trade!
   action, info = safe_agent.act(obs, state, market_data)
   ```

5. **Monitor**
   ```bash
   python monitoring/production_monitor.py
   # Runs 24/7, alerts on issues
   ```
