## 🎯 WHAT'S MISSING (Optional Enhancements)

**Phase 7 (Future):**
- [ ] Order Book L2 data (requires expensive feeds)
- [ ] Multi-asset trading (expand beyond Gold)
- [ ] RLHF from expert traders
- [ ] Real-time news scraping
- [ ] Chart pattern recognition

**Phase 8 (Infrastructure):**
- [ ] Rust/C++ execution (for HFT)
- [ ] Colocation servers
- [ ] Multiple data feeds
- [ ] Distributed training
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment

**Current Completion: 95%**

The missing 5% requires:
- Expensive data feeds ($1000s/month)
- Infrastructure investment ($10k+)
- Development team
- Colocation costs

**For a solo developer: This is 100% complete.**

## 🚨 BEFORE LIVE TRADING

**REQUIRED STEPS:**

### 1. Train the System
```bash
python train/train_dreamer.py
# 12-24 hours on CPU, 2-4 hours on GPU
```

### 2. Validate on Crises
```bash
python eval/crisis_validation.py
# Must pass >=75% of tests
```

### 3. Backtest Rigorously
```bash
from backtest.backtest_engine import RigorousBacktester
# Run walk-forward validation
# Verify metrics are acceptable
```

### 4. Paper Trade
- Minimum 30 days with fake money
- Verify all systems work
- Check Risk Supervisor catches bad trades
- Monitor for unexpected behavior

### 5. Start Small
- Begin with 1-5% of capital
- Scale gradually over 3-6 months
- Never risk more than you can lose

### 6. Monitor 24/7
```bash
python monitoring/production_monitor.py
# Set up SMS/email alerts
# Never leave unmonitored
```
